# Heart Attack Analysis Prediction

In this dataset, I performed data analysis to determine the relationships between different variables and how they contribute to heart attack cases; later, I predicted what things to avoid in order to be at lower risk of heart attacks; and I built machine learning models to predict which types of people are at higher risk and which are not.
