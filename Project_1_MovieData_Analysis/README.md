# Movie Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on a dataset of 1 million movie records, each categorized by genres and various attributes. The project is primarily implemented using the Python libraries **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. This README provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to use it.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze a large dataset of movies with various attributes, such as genres, release year, and user ratings, to gain insights and answer specific questions related to the movie industry. The dataset contains 1 million records, making it an extensive and rich source of information for movie enthusiasts and analysts.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning:** The project includes data cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure the dataset is in a suitable format for analysis. This includes handling missing values, data type conversions, and removing duplicates.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We perform EDA to gain an understanding of the dataset. This involves generating summary statistics, visualizations, and identifying key trends and patterns.

- **Analysis:** The project aims to answer specific questions related to movies, such as:
  - What are the most popular movie genres over time?
  - How do movie ratings correlate with genres?
  - Are there any significant trends in movie releases over the years?
  - And more.

- **Visualization:** We create visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to help convey insights more effectively.

- **Data Insights:** The project provides insights and answers to questions that can be valuable for movie studios, distributors, and enthusiasts.

## Requirements
